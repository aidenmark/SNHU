DriverPass Project Reflection

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass would like to create a system in the form of a website that will provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests.  A fully functional website was created that allowed for students to book, modify, and cancel on-the-road training; allow students to take online practice exams; and provide employee admin access to make changes as needed to further improve the system.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did well with understanding and identifying the clients needs and what things needed to be implemented to meet the requirements of the project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would choose to revise the UML diagrams.  In the end, I found that I did not understand the diagrams as much as I thought and as a result they did not clearly show what I was trying to convey about the system.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

To interpret the user's needs and implement them into a system design, it is important to gather requirements through interviews, surveys, and feedback. This information should then be analyzed and translated into specific features and functionalities that meet the user's needs. Considering the user's needs is crucial as it ensures that the final product is user-friendly, efficient, and effective.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

There are various approaches to software design, but commonly, it involves analyzing requirements, creating a design plan, developing the software, testing it, and implementing it. To analyze and design a system, one could use techniques such as UML diagrams, flowcharts, data modeling, and prototyping.  Strategies could include Agile development, DevOps, and Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).
