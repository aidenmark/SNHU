8-2 Journal: Portfolio Item

**1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future**?

When it comes to writing programs, I try to keep things simple and organized so they are easy to read and update later. For the CRUD Python module in Project One, I made sure each part of the code focused on doing one specific thing, like creating, reading, updating, or deleting records. This made the code easier to follow and reuse. In Project Two, this really was helpful because I could connect the dashboard widgets to the database without having to rewrite anything. I was able to just use the CRUD methods I had already built. This approach saved time and made it easy to make changes when I needed to. I can see myself using this CRUD module in the future for other projects, like managing user accounts or tracking inventory. Since it’s already set up to handle database operations, I can adapt it to fit other needs without starting from scratch.

**2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

When I tackle a problem, I like to break it into smaller steps and figure out the best way to approach each one. For Grazioso Salvare’s database and dashboard requirements, I started by thinking about what the client needed the system to do. From there, I designed the database and wrote the queries to get the right data. This project felt different from others I have worked on because I had to think about how the database, Python code, and dashboard all worked together. It was not just about one part, it was about making sure everything connected smoothly. In the future, I would use this same approach for other client requests. I would start by understanding their needs, design the database to be as efficient as possible, and make sure the code is easy to maintain and update.

**3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Computer scientists solve problems and build tools that help people get work done faster and more efficiently. For example, in the Grazioso Salvare project, the database and dashboard I worked on helped the company access important data quickly and make better decisions. This kind of work matters because it saves time, reduces mistakes, and helps businesses focus on their goals. For Grazioso Salvare, having an organized system means they can spend less time on paperwork and more time helping animals. I have learned that even a small project can make a big difference when it’s designed well. It feels good to know that my work could help a company run more smoothly.
