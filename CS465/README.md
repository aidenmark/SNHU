**Architecture**

For this project, I used different types of frontend development, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and Angular. Express HTML and JavaScript were great for building basic pages quickly,
but Angular’s single-page application (SPA) features made the admin side more interactive and efficient, especially for tasks like updating trips. The backend used MongoDB because it’s flexible 
and works well with JSON, which made storing and managing data easier.

**Functionality**

JSON is different from JavaScript because it’s just a data format, but it helped connect the frontend and backend by letting them send and receive data in a way both could understand. For example, 
when adding a trip, the Angular frontend sent the data as JSON to the Express backend, which stored it in MongoDB. Refactoring helped improve the project, like creating reusable components for the 
trip cards. This made the code cleaner and easier to update later.

**Testing**

Testing the project meant making sure the APIs worked and handled requests securely. I used Postman to test endpoints like login and trip updates, checking that they responded correctly. Adding 
authentication made testing more important because I needed to make sure only authorized users could change the data. This process showed me how important security is in a full stack application.

**Reflection**

This project helped me understand how all the pieces—frontend, backend, and database—fit together to create a functional and secure full stack application. Through this course, I gained hands-on 
experience with tools like Angular, Express, and MongoDB, as well as testing APIs and implementing security features. These experiences not only strengthened my ability to build secure and 
efficient web applications but also made me a more marketable candidate in software development by providing real-world, practical skills.
