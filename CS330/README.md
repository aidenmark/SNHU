**1. How do I approach designing software?**
- Learning What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
- What design process did you follow for your project work?
- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

When I design software, I like to keep things simple and start by understanding the project requirements. I break the work into smaller parts to make it easier to manage. For this project, I thought about what objects I needed for the scene and how they should be placed. This project helped me notice how small details, like lighting, textures, and object positioning, can change how realistic a scene looks. I also improved my planning skills by thinking through the layout before coding. I began by deciding on a basic desk setup. I thought about which shapes to use for each object and sketched the idea in my mind. I started with creating the objects, then added textures and lighting. When something didn’t look right, I adjusted it until I was satisfied. Breaking projects into smaller steps and planning ahead really helped. I’ll use this approach in future work to stay organized and avoid feeling overwhelmed. It’s also helpful to test things along the way instead of waiting until the end.

**2. How do I approach developing programs?**
- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
- How did iteration factor into your development?
- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

I usually start with the basics to make sure the main structure works, then add details like textures, lighting, or interactivity. I write comments in my code to keep things clear, which makes it easier to fix mistakes. I used functions to separate different parts of the code, which kept things organized and made updates easier. I also experimented with texture scaling and worked on balancing the lighting. Iteration was a big part of my process. I kept testing the scene, adjusting object positions, textures, and lighting to get it right. Every time I changed something, I checked how it looked and improved it step by step. At first, I focused on just making things work. As I moved through the milestones, I realized how important it is to keep code organized and well-commented. By the end, I was using functions to keep things clean and make changes easier.

**3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computer science helps me build the technical skills I need for software engineering, especially in fintech. Coding and problem-solving are key parts of the kind of work I want to do. Learning about graphics and visualizations taught me how visuals can make information clearer. These skills could help in future classes, especially when working with data visualizations or simulations. In my future career, being able to create visual tools or represent data clearly will be valuable. Especially in fintech, making software that’s both functional and easy to understand is important, and this project gave me a foundation for that.
